# Identifying the software engineer god complex

Last time I wrote about the software engineer god complex. This time I want to talk about how to identify it. This will mostly be a discussion of symptoms. But like most discussions of symptoms, there is potential for abuse. So do not be too quick to diagnose and label someone as having the software engineer god complex. It is possible to have some of the symptoms without having the software engineer god complex. It is also possible to have the software engineer god complex without having all the symptoms. Also it is a matter of degree. Some people have a mild case of the software engineer god complex while others have a severe case. And sometimes people just have a bad day. So take it easy on the labelling. #SoftwareEngineering #EngineeringManagement #ProductManagement

I've got some interesting feedback about the last article and had some interesting discussions about it. It is actually remarkable how similar some of the stories I've been told are. At some point I couldn't help but think I was hearing about the same person in different organisations. Anyway, here are some of the symptoms and signs of the software engineer god complex.

## The symptoms

### A Savior complex

Perhaps the most common symptom I've seen and been told about is the Saviour Complex. This is where the engineer feels that they are the only one who can save the project, team, organisation, maybe even the world. If only everyone else followed their lead. In the feedback I got from the first article, those with the complex believed they could and should fix the people they manage, often without bothering to get buy-in from those they wanted to fix and not explaining themselves.

### A tendency towards personal experience over industry standards and best practices

The other common symptom of the engineering god complex is a tendency to favour one's own perspective and opinion over industry best practice. This is not to say that industry best practice is always right. But it is to say that industry best practice is a good place to start. If you are going to deviate from industry best practice, you should have a good reason for doing so. And that reason should be based on evidence and not just your own personal experience. 

For some reason this is particularly common when it comes to implementations of AGILE. I have seen people who have never worked in an AGILE environment insist that AGILE is not the right way to do things. I have also seen people who have never worked in an AGILE environment insist that AGILE is the only way to do things. Some will claim experience with AGILE and then proceed to do things that directly contravene AGILE principles and values( and then often claim AGILE is the problem).

### A tendency to assume expertise where there is little or none

Watch out for a tendency to assume expertise where there is little or none. This is particularly common when it comes to things like programming languages, frameworks, and tools. It is also common when it comes to things like software architecture and design. Oftentimes the experience will be in a field that is related to the one they are talking about but not the same. So you might find a senior engineer with decades of overall experience but maybe only a year's experience with the language or framework they are talking about dismissing the opinion of a more junior engineer with significantly more experience with the language or framework than they have. Or you might find an experienced software engineer dismissing the views of an experienced product manager ... on product management.

### A focus on what to do rather than why

I've written before about why managers should focus more on telling their reports the whys of directives and decisions rather than the whats. Engineers with a god complex are often quick to offer up suggestions on what to do, but they are often short on why it should be done that way. As mentioned early on, they'll likely fallback to personal subjective experience. On the extreme side, if they can't offer a good reason for doing something, they might just say "because I said so" or the more subtle, "... and that's final!" The latter is a sure sign of a god complex. If you find yourself saying "because I said so" to your team, you might want to take a step back and think about why you are doing that. It is possible that you are just being a jerk. But it is also possible that you are trying to hide a lack of confidence in your own ability to explain why you are doing something.

### Poor handling of criticism or questioning 

People who can't explain why, often have a tough time handling criticism or questioning of their decisions. They might get defensive, angry or passive aggressive. They might even resort to sarcasm. They'll often try to isolate themselves from people who might challenge them. They'll avoid hires who might have enough expertise to challenge them and hire those who are more likely to agree with them or even submit to them.

### A failure to recognise competence in others

People with a god complex might be quick to dismiss the competence of others often in areas they are not competent in themselves. If you are lucky you might catch this by way of disparities in performance reviews. If you are not lucky it might lead to you losing good people. Leaders with a god complex might claim incompetence in people who are actually competent. This is mostly likely because that same competence would put them in conflict with the leader. So they are more likely to dismiss it as competence rather than admit fault in themselves.

### Other Symptoms

Here are some other symptoms I've seen or been told about that I find are worth mentioning;

    1. Poor Listening Skills
    2. They practice divide and rule: They'll often isolate people who challenge them or disagree with them. Often this is done by restructuring such that they are in fewer meetings together
    3. For some reason they often seem to have a poor relationship with the product team.

What do you think? What are some of the symptoms you've seen or experienced? Please share in the comments or DM. I'd love to hear from you.  Next time I'll try talk about how to deal with the software engineer god complex. If you have ideas for that, please share them too.

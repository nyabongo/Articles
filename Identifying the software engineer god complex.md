# Identifying the software engineer god complex

Last time I wrote about the software engineer god complex. This time I want to talk about how to identify it. This will mostly be a discussion of symptoms. But like most discussions of symptoms, there is potential for abuse. So do not be too quick to diagnose and label someone as having the software engineer god complex. It is possible to have some of the symptoms without having the software engineer god complex. It is also possible to have the software engineer god complex without having all the symptoms.
Also it is a matter of degree. Some people have a mild case of the software engineer god complex while others have a severe case. Perhaps all of us have a mild case of it. I know I do. I am not immune to it. I am not even sure I can identify it in myself. I am just trying to be aware of it and manage it.

## The symptoms

### A tendency towards personal experience over industry standards and best practices

Probably the most common symptom of the engineering god complex is a tendency to favor ones own perspective and opinion over industry best practice. This is not to say that industry best practice is always right. But it is to say that industry best practice is a good place to start. If you are going to deviate from industry best practice, you should have a good reason for doing so. And that reason should be based on evidence and not just your own personal experience. 

For some reason this is particularly common when it comes to implementations of AGILE. I have seen people who have never worked in an AGILE environment insist that AGILE is not the right way to do things. I have also seen people who have never worked in an AGILE environment insist that AGILE is the only way to do things. Some will claim experience with AGILE and then proceeed to do things that directly contravene AGILE principles and values.

### A tendency to assume expertise where there is little or none

Watch out for a tendency to assume expertise where there is little or none. This is particularly common when it comes to things like programming languages, frameworks, and tools. It is also common when it comes to things like software architecture and design. Often times the experience will be in a field that is related to the one they are talking about but not the same. So you might find a senior engineer with decades of overall experience but maybe only a years experience with the language or framework they are talking about dismissing the opinion of a more a junior engineer with significantly more experience with the language or framework than they have.
Or you might find an experienced software engineer dismissing the views of an experienced product manager ... on product management.

### A focus on what to do rather than why

I've written before about why managers should focus more on telling their reports the whys of directives and decisions rather than the whats. Engineers with a  god complex are often quick to offer up suggestions on what to be done, but they are often short on the why it should be done that way. As, mentioned early on, they'll likely fallback to personal subjective experience.
On the extreme side, if they can't offer a good reason for doing something, they might just say "because I said so". This is a sure sign of a god complex. If you find yourself saying "because I said so" to your team, you might want to take a step back and think about why you are doing that. It is possible that you are just being a jerk. But it is also possible that you are trying to hide a lack of confidence in your own ability to explain why you are doing something.

### Poor handling of criticism or questioning 

People who can't explain why, often have a tough time handling criticism or questioning of their decisions. They might get defensive. They might get angry. They might get passive aggressive. They might get passive aggressive and then get angry. They might even resort to sarcasm.

### A failure to recognise competence in others

People with a god complex might be quick to dismiss the competence of others often in areas they are not competent in themselves. If you are lucky you might catch this by way of disparities in performance reviews. If you are not lucky it might lead to you losing good people. Leaders with a god complex might claim incompetance in people who are actually competent. This is mostly likely because that same competance would put them in conflict with the leader. So they are more likely to dismiss it as incompetance rather than admit fault in themselves.

### Lousy listening skills

People with a god complex are often poor listeners. They are often quick to dismiss the opinions of others and cut in with their own.
